/**
 * API for configuring continuous cache queries.
 * <p>
 * Continuous queries allow to register a remote filter and a local listener
 * for cache updates. If an update event passes the filter, it will be sent to
 * the node that executed the query and local listener will be notified.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, you can execute initial query to get currently existing data.
 * Query can be of any type (SQL, TEXT or SCAN) and can be set via {@link #setInitialPredicate(Query)}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * Query can be executed either on all nodes in topology using {@link IgniteCache#query(Query)}
 * method of only on the local node using {@link IgniteCache#localQuery(Query)} method.
 * Note that in case query is distributed and a new node joins, it will get the remote
 * filter for the query during discovery process before it actually joins topology,
 * so no updates will be missed.
 * <p>
 * To create a new instance of continuous query use {@link Query#continuous()} factory method.
 * <h1 class="header">Example</h1>
 * As an example, suppose we have cache with {@code 'Person'} objects and we need
 * to query all persons with salary above 1000.
 * <p>
 * Here is the {@code Person} class:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class Person {
 *     // Name.
 *     private String name;
 *
 *     // Salary.
 *     private double salary;
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can create and execute continuous query like so:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * // Create new continuous query.
 * ContinuousQuery qry = Query.continuous();
 *
 * // Initial iteration query will return all persons with salary above 1000.
 * qry.setInitialPredicate(Query.scan(new IgniteBiPredicate&lt;UUID, Person&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override public boolean apply(UUID id, Person p) {
 *         return p.getSalary() &gt; 1000;
 *     }
 * }));
 *
 *
 * // Callback that is called locally when update notifications are received.
 * // It simply prints out information about all created persons.
 * qry.setLocalListener(new CacheEntryUpdatedListener&lt;UUID, Person&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override public void onUpdated(Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;? extends UUID, ? extends Person&gt;&gt; evts) {
 *         for (CacheEntryEvent&lt;? extends UUID, ? extends Person&gt; e : evts) {
 *             Person p = e.getValue();
 *
 *             X.println("&gt;&gt;&gt;");
 *             X.println("&gt;&gt;&gt; " + p.getFirstName() + " " + p.getLastName() +
 *                 "'s salary is " + p.getSalary());
 *             X.println("&gt;&gt;&gt;");
 *         }
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * // Continuous listener will be notified for persons with salary above 1000.
 * qry.setRemoteFilter(new CacheEntryEventFilter&lt;UUID, Person&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override public boolean evaluate(CacheEntryEvent&lt;? extends UUID, ? extends Person&gt; e) {
 *         return e.getValue().getSalary() &gt; 1000;
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * // Execute query and get cursor that iterates through initial data.
 * QueryCursor&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;UUID, Person&gt;&gt; cur = cache.query(qry);
 * </pre>
 * This will execute query on all nodes that have cache you are working with and
 * listener will start to receive notifications for cache updates.
 * <p>
 * To stop receiving updates call {@link QueryCursor#close()} method:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * cur.close();
 * </pre>
 * Note that this works even if you didn't provide initial query. Cursor will
 * be empty in this case, but it will still unregister listeners when {@link QueryCursor#close()}
 * is called.
